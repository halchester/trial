# React challenge

There are two challenges:

1. [Live Coding](https://github.com/ageekdev/react-challenge/tree/main/live-coding), during interview, you'll be given time limit, around 2 hours. During which you'll demostrate your coding abilities by finishing the incomplete project. Don't worry, you can take the test off-screen. Once the time is up, we'll review your code about 1 hour, and then we'll continue our interview and you'll have to explain how you completed given tasks.

2. [Take Home](https://github.com/ageekdev/react-challenge/tree/main/take-home), you can take this off-screen and finish the assignment within given days, typically 1-3 days depending on your experience.
